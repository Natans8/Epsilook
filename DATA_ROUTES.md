# Epsilook data routes

Every path data takes from an upstream source to a pixel in the app. This is the map of *where things come from*;
`build/build_data.py` is the implementation and
`CLAUDE.md` holds the decisions and gotchas behind it.

Where a route ends — the pill it becomes, the category word it answers to, how a query token matches it — is
**[PILLS.md](PILLS.md)**. The two meet at
`docs/js/pilltypes.js`, which declares one record per kind of content: the route's corpus, the spells it reaches, and
its keyword.

Read it in five stages:

1. [Sources](#1-sources) — what gets downloaded, from where
2. [The visual graph](#2-the-visual-graph-spine) — the spine every visual route hangs off
3. [Payload routes](#3-payload-routes) — the ~20 routes from a kit/spell to something showable
4. [The pack](#4-the-pack) — how it lands in the UI
5. [Version differences](#5-version-differences) — what each of the six builds does and doesn't have
6. [Runtime routes](#6-runtime-routes-browser-on-demand) — what the browser fetches live

Nothing is fetched from a local DB dump, and nothing is fetched per-result at runtime. Everything the search touches is
baked into the pack.

## 1. Sources

| Source                      | URL shape                                         | Role                                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **wago.tools**              | `wago.tools/db2/{table}/csv?build={version}`      | The 33 client db2 tables. Version-pinned, so a pack always matches its build.                                                       |

### TDB does two unrelated jobs

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  TDB["TDB release .7z"] --> WORLD["world dump"]
  TDB --> HOT["hotfixes dump"]
  WORLD --> CT["creature_template<br/>creature → NPC name"]
  WORLD --> CTM["creature_template_model<br/>creature → display ids"]
  CT --> USE1["morphs + summons<br/>(server-side; the client never ships it)"]
  CTM --> USE1
  HOT --> OV["9 tables overlaid onto the<br/>wago rows BY ROW ID"]
  OV --> USE2["post-ship corrections<br/>(TDB wins where it has a row)"]
```

**World tables are the only source of creature names and displays** — that data lives on the server, so without a
`TDB_RELEASES` entry morph pills render as
`creature #<id>`. **Hotfix tables** are the rows Blizzard patched over the wire after the build shipped; they are
applied on top of wago by row ID for
`spell_name`, `spell_x_spell_visual`, `spell_visual`, `spell_visual_missile`,
`spell_visual_effect_name`, `spell_effect`, `spell_misc`,
`creature_display_info`, `creature_model_data`.

A version with no TDB entry still builds — morphs stay unresolved, hotfixes don't apply, and the build logs both.

---

## 2. The visual graph spine

Almost every visual route starts here. Both hops are many-to-many.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  S["Spell<br/>(SpellName, or Spell.Name_lang pre-BfA)"]
  SXSV["SpellXSpellVisual"]
  SV["SpellVisual"]
  SVE["SpellVisualEvent"]
  K["SpellVisualKit"]
  SVKE["SpellVisualKitEffect<br/>EffectType dispatch"]
  MS["SpellVisualMissile<br/>(missile set)"]
  S --> SXSV --> SV
  SV -->|" Caster/HostileSpellVisualID<br/>(redirect, + target bit) "| SV
  SV -->|" SpellVisualEvent rows "| SVE -->|" + TargetType "| K
  SV -->|" SpellVisualMissileSetID<br/>+ RaidSpellVisualMissileSetID "| MS
  SV -->|" AnimEventSoundID "| AES["SoundKitEntry → sound fids"]
  K --> SVKE
```

Three things to hold onto:

**The kit edge carries a target mask.** `SpellVisualEvent.TargetType` says *who the kit plays on*, and it rides along
with everything that kit contributes. A visual can reach the same kit through several event rows, so masks union per
edge. Impact kits genuinely carry duplicate rows differing only in TargetType — that is why a row can be caster *and*
target.

| TargetType | bit | search word | icon meaning                                                        |
|------------|-----|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1          | 1   | `caster`    | on the caster                                                       |
| 2          | 2   | `target`    | on the target                                                       |
| 3          | 4   | `area`      | on the ground at the target                                         |
| 4          | 8   | `target`    | on the target only, never the caster                                |
| 5          | 16  | `area`      | on the ground where the missile lands                               |
| 0          | —   | —           | effectively unused (1 row in 207,241 on 9.2.7); contributes nothing |

**…but `TargetType` is relative to the CAST, not to the visual.** It distinguishes
"the caster" from "the unit being cast at" — and on a **self-cast spell those are the same unit**, where the client
still writes `Target`. Taken literally that draws a *target* icon on Divine Shield's own bubble, Ice Barrier,
Invisibility and every other self-buff's aura visual: 32,136 spells and 48,025 model rows on 9.2.7.
`SpellEffect.ImplicitTarget` is what tells a self-cast from a real one, so the two tables must be read together
(`resolve_target_mask` in `build_data.py`).

*Which* effect row to believe depends on **when** the visual plays —
`SpellVisualEvent.StartEvent` (`meta/enums/SpellVisualEventEvent.dbde`: 1/2 precast, 3 cast, 4/5 travel, 6 impact, **7/8
aura**, 9/10 area trigger, 11/12 channel, 13 one-shot). So each kit edge keeps its mask split in two halves:

| phase                     | who to believe                            | why                                                                                                                                                                             |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **aura** (StartEvent 7/8) | the `APPLY_AURA` effects' implicit target | the visual belongs to the aura, so it plays on whoever *carries* it — which can disagree with the rest of the spell (Vanish, Blink: a self-aura beside effects aimed at others) |
| every other phase         | *all* effects' implicit targets           | they share the cast's frame, so "Target" is the caster only when the whole spell is self-cast (Healing Potion, Eye of Kilrogg)                                                  |

A `Target` bit becomes `Caster` when its half's test says the spell targets only the caster. **Only that bit is
rewritten** — `TargetType 4` ("Target, not caster")
says outright that it is not the caster, so it never flips. The rule is monotone: it replaces bit 2 with bit 1 and can
never clear a caster bit, which makes the transition histogram a build oracle (9.2.7: `2→1` 37,485, `3→1` 10,276,
`7→5` 153, `10→9` 21, `18→17` 18; plus 22 rows `2→3` where the aura phase flips but another phase keeps a genuine
target).

The contrast that shows it working: **17 Power Word: Shield** (`TARGET_UNIT_TARGET_ALLY`)
keeps `holydivineshield_state_base` on *target*, while **642 Divine Shield**
(`TARGET_UNIT_CASTER`) moves `cfx_paladin_divineshield_statebase` to *caster* — the same kind of shield-state visual,
correctly told apart. Banish and Polymorph are untouched.

Note this reads `StartEvent` **only** far enough to get the icons right; the full phase axis (surfacing cast/aura/impact
per pill) is deliberately not built. When it is: 97.7% of kits appear in just one phase, so phase is nearly a property
of the kit, and `StartEvent`/`EndEvent` are populated on all ten packs (no drift).

**The missile path bypasses events entirely**, so missile content carries *no*
mask — that is exactly the ~4% of unmasked rows in every pack, and the row count matching the missile row count is a
good build oracle.

**A `SpellVisual` can redirect to another `SpellVisual`.** Four columns on the row name a substitute visual the client
swaps in (`VISUAL_REDIRECTS` in
`build_data.py`); the build follows them so the spell also reaches everything the substitute carries. This matters
because the redirected-to visual is usually reachable no other way — on 9.2.7 only 37 of 228 caster targets and 30 of
257 hostile targets also appear in `SpellXSpellVisual` — so following the redirect is what makes that content visible at
all, not a re-labelling of rows already shown (263 spells gain a caster/target model bit this way).

| Column                                         | extra bit    | meaning                                    |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `CasterSpellVisualID`                          | `caster` (1) | what the caster themself sees              |
| `HostileSpellVisualID`                         | `target` (2) | what a hostile target sees                 |
| `LowViolenceSpellVisualID`                     | —            | client-setting variant, no target semantic |
| `ReducedUnexpectedCameraMovementSpellVisualID` | —            | client-setting variant, no target semantic |

The bit rides along with everything reached through that redirect, exactly like a `TargetType` mask, and unions with it.
Two traps the build handles and any future edit must keep: **the redirect graph has cycles** (a self-reference and a
two-cycle on 9.2.7, chains up to 3 hops), so expansion is a mask-fixpoint worklist, not recursion; and **a hotfix row
replaces the wago `SpellVisual` row wholesale**, so the redirect columns (and `AnimEventSoundID`) join the TDB hotfix
overlay or a hotfixed visual silently loses them.

## 3. Payload routes

### 3a. Kit dispatch — `SpellVisualKitEffect.EffectType`

The single busiest fan-out in the build. `EffectType` says which table `Effect`
points at.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  KE["SpellVisualKitEffect"]
  KE -->|" 1 "| PROC["SpellProceduralEffect"]
  KE -->|" 5 "| SK["SoundKitID"]
  KE -->|" 6 "| SVA["SpellVisualAnim"]
  KE -->|" 7 "| SH["ShadowyEffect"]
  KE -->|" 8 "| EM["SpellEffectEmission"]
  KE -->|" 11 "| DE["DissolveEffect"]
  KE -->|" 12 "| EG["EdgeGlowEffect"]
  KE -->|" 13 "| BE["BeamEffect"]
  KE -->|" 17 "| BA["BarrageEffect"]
  KE -->|" 19 "| SVSE["SpellVisualScreenEffect"]
  PROC --> PT["dispatched again by Type<br/>(see 3b)"]
  SK --> SKE["SoundKitEntry → sound fids"]
  SVA --> AK["AnimKitID → AnimKitSegment"]
  SVA --> LA["Initial/LoopAnimID → AnimationData"]
  SH --> GH["ghost — 2 packed colors"]
  EM --> AM["SpellVisualKitAreaModel → model fid"]
  DE --> TBS["TextureBlendSet → texture fids"]
  EG --> GL["glow — packed RGB + alpha"]
  BE --> CH["SpellChainEffects"]
  BA --> EN["SpellVisualEffectName → model fid"]
  SVSE --> SE["ScreenEffect"]
```

The remaining EffectType values were audited and deliberately dropped: **2**
(ModelAttach-by-id) is 100% redundant with the parent-kit walk; **10**
(UnitSoundType) plays the target's own sound and names no file; **15/20** are absent from the data; the rest carry no
model or sound columns.

### 3b. Proc dispatch — `SpellProceduralEffect.Type`

`Type` is the client's character-procedure index, so it selects both the handler *and* which `Value_n` column holds the
payload. This is the second fan-out.

| Type      | Payload column                      | Becomes                      |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 0, 12, 26 | `Value_0` → SpellChainEffects       | **chain** (beams)            |
| 1         | `Value_0` packed RGB                | **tint**                     |
| 7         | `Value_0..3` → AnimationData        | **stance** anims             |
| 9         | `Value_0` → SpellVisualKitAreaModel | **model** (`ground`)         |
| 11        | —                                   | **freeze** (valueless)       |
| 14        | `Value_0` alpha 0..1                | **transparency %**           |
| 18        | —                                   | **camo** (valueless)         |
| 21        | `Value_2` strength 0..1             | **desaturate %**             |
| 22        | `Value_3` packed RGB                | **ghost** (material recolor) |
| 23        | `Value_3` packed RGB                | **tint** (material recolor)  |
| 27        | `Value_0` → WeaponTrail             | **model** (`trail`)          |

Colors are `0xRRGGBB`; `INT_MIN` is the "unset" sentinel. The types not surfaced (2–6, 8, 10, 13, 15–17, 19–20, 24–25,
28–34) are renderer or gameplay state, or too rare to be worth a pill. The full decode with evidence is in CLAUDE.md →
*Proc type decode*.

### 3c. The six model routes

Every `(spell, model)` row is tagged with **how** the model is used. Same fid can appear once per category.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A1["SpellVisualKitModelAttach"] --> EN["SpellVisualEffectName"]
  M1["SpellVisual → SpellVisualMissile"] --> EN
  E17["kit ET 17 → BarrageEffect"] --> EN
  EN -->|" Type 0 (.ModelFileDataID) "| LF["listfile → model path"]

  E8["kit ET 8 → SpellEffectEmission"] --> AM["SpellVisualKitAreaModel<br/>.ModelFileDataID"]
  P9["proc Type 9"] --> AM
  P27["proc Type 27 → WeaponTrail<br/>.FileDataID"] --> LF
  AM --> LF
  A1 -.->|" category "| C0["attach — no word, loose pills"]
  A1 -.->|" category (Type 1) "| C6["item"]
  A1 -.->|" category (Type 2) "| C5["display"]
  M1 -.->|" category "| C1["missile"]
  E17 -.->|" category "| C4["barrage"]
  E8 -.->|" category "| C2["ground"]
  P9 -.->|" category "| C2
  P27 -.->|" category "| C3["trail"]
```

`SpellVisualKitAreaModel` carries its fid **directly** — no
`SpellVisualEffectName` hop. Note `ground`, not `area`: the target words include
`area` and the two mean different things (only 42% of this category's rows carry an area target bit).

**`SpellVisualEffectName.Type`** picks how the effect-name resolves to a model:
**0 = FileDataID** (`ModelFileDataID`, every route above), **1 = Item**
(`GenericID` = Item::ID), **2 = CreatureDisplayInfo** (`GenericID` = a CreatureDisplayID). On the **attach route only**,
a Type-2 row resolves that display through `CreatureDisplayInfo → CreatureModelData` (pure client data — no TDB) into
the `display` model category. Its pill sits in the Models column but wears the morph pill's buttons (Wowhead model
viewer by displayId, ⧉ copy displayId, `.morph`, `.lookup display creature`) and keeps its attachment point like any
other attached model. The label is the model's base filename. The category word is **`display`**, not `creature`: a
creature model's path lives under `creature/…`, so `creature` would collide with ~21% of the model-file corpus by the
filename-substring rule. Missiles/barrage keep reading
`ModelFileDataID` for every Type (they carry no CreatureDisplay/Item content).

**Type 1 = an Item::ID → the `item` model category** (attach route only). The item carries its own model through the
appearance chain
`ItemModifiedAppearance → ItemAppearance → ItemDisplayInfo → ModelResourcesID
→ ModelFileData.FileDataID` (pure client data, so it works on the TDB-less Classic packs; 99.8% of reached items resolve
on 9.2.7), plus the display name and quality from `ItemSearchName` and the inventory icon from
`ItemAppearance.DefaultIconFileDataID`. `ItemSparse` is deliberately **not**
downloaded: measured to add zero names over `ItemSearchName` for this population, at 6× the size. The pill has two
shapes, split on whether the item has a name (about two-thirds do; the rest are internal props — unnamed potions,
dynamite, gizmos — that exist only to be held in a visual):

- **named** → `[Wowhead item page] · {target}{icon}{name} · attach · ⧉ copy
  item id · .additem · .lookup item {name}`. The name is coloured by the item's quality (the classic poor→artifact ramp;
  colour only, **not** searchable). Both the leading `[wh]` button *and the icon* are Wowhead item links opening the
  model view (`item={id}/#modelviewer`) — that `<a href>` anchor is the app's proven tooltip trigger, so hovering the
  icon raises the item tooltip. The label stays a click-to-search button (with a `data-wowhead` mirror for its own
  tooltip) rather than a link, so clicking the name searches instead of navigating.
- **nameless** → `[3D viewer] · {target}{icon}{model base name} · attach ·
  .lookup item {model base name}`. No Wowhead, no `.additem`, no id copy — none resolve without a name — and
  `.lookup item` falls back to the model's base filename (no extension; `.lookup item` accepts either a name or a model
  name). The icon still reads (you can see it is a potion or a bomb).

The category word is **`item`**; it collides with ~4.3% of the model-file corpus (the `item/objectcomponents/…` paths)
by the filename-substring rule — well under the ~21% that ruled out `creature`, and coherent because those files *are*
item models. `model:"item <name>"` matches on the item name via a dedicated corpus (`itemSearchL`); the model file and
category word match through the ordinary model index. This is the **attach route only** — the 62 missile-route Type-1
effect-names on 9.2.7 render nothing, matching the "item attachments" scope.

**Types 3–10 = a weapon the caster already has.** They carry *no* model of their own (`ModelFileDataID` **and**
`GenericID` both 0) while attaching to weapon/hand M2 points and being frequently reused as a missile — i.e. the model
is the real item the caster is holding, resolved client-side at cast. The `Type` picks the **slot**, and dual-wield
emits a mainhand+offhand pair. `SpellVisualEffectNameType.dbde`
defines only 0–2, but [wowdev.wiki/EnumeratedString](https://wowdev.wiki/EnumeratedString#SpellVisualEffectName::Type)
carries the client's own enum, and it matches what the data showed:

| Type | official name                 | pill                 | evidence (spell names)                                       |
|------|-------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3    | Unit - Item - Main hand       | `equipped main hand` | Throw Spear, Heroic Throw, Javelin Toss, Impale, Fishing     |
| 4    | Unit - Item - Off hand        | `equipped off hand`  | Pandaren Spirit (`T3@LargeWeaponRight + T4@LargeWeaponLeft`) |
| 5    | Unit - Item - Ranged          | `equipped ranged`    | Arcane Shot, Pistol Barrage, Hold Rifle, Wailing Arrow       |
| 6    | Unit - Ammo - Basic           | `equipped ammo`      | Sha Corruption (2 rows)                                      |
| 7    | Unit - Ammo - Preferred       | `equipped ammo`      | missile-only (1 row)                                         |
| 8    | Main hand *(ignore disarmed)* | `equipped main hand` | Hold/Sharpen/Throw Sword, Whirling Blade                     |
| 9    | Off hand *(ignore disarmed)*  | `equipped off hand`  | Thal'kiel skull, Crystalline Swords                          |
| 10   | Ranged *(ignore disarmed)*    | `equipped ranged`    | Hold Rifles, Barrage, Death Blossom                          |

Eight types, **four pills**: "(ignore disarmed)" is a visibility rule for a disarmed caster rather than a different
weapon, and basic-vs-preferred ammo says which arrow the client picks, so both collapse. Because there is no file to
name, these rows carry a **sentinel fid per slot** (`SYNTHETIC_MODEL_FILES`, −1…−4) and render as a flat marker pill —
no 3D, texture, Wowhead or `.lo` button — while keeping their category (`attach` vs thrown-as-`missile`), attachment
point and target icon. Each sentinel gets a synthetic `files` entry whose *path is its label*, so it renders and
searches through the ordinary filename route with no special case: a pill click searches `model:"equipped off hand"`
exactly as a real model pill searches its own filename. Every label opens with **`equipped`** — a word no real model
path carries — so `model:equipped` still finds the whole family (where `model:weapon` would also catch every `weapon/…`
file). That one word is also the only thing autocomplete offers: the slots are *values*, and only meta words belong
there (the `attach <point>` rule, §3c). The rows'
`StartAnimID`/`AnimID`/`EndAnimID`/`AnimKitID` already reach the Animations column (§3e), so what the spell *plays* was
searchable before the model was.

**Trap — "fileless" is not always spelled 0.** The Classic re-release clients backfill these rows with an **unnamed
placeholder fid** instead: Cata 4.4.2 points all seven of its weapon rows at fid **1255628**, WotLK 3.4.3 one — the very
same effect-name IDs (8905–8909, 9007, 50201) that are fid 0 on every other build. One fid shared across six weapon
slots is not a per-weapon model, and taken literally it renders a junk `file #1255628` pill. So a weapon row's fid is
trusted **only when the listfile can name it**, which keeps genuinely hardcoded weapons (Sylvanas's bow, fid 3597252 on
9.2.7+) rendering as the real models they are. The check runs once in `read_model_sources`, after the hotfix overlay,
and rewrites the placeholder to 0 so every downstream route takes its existing "no file → sentinel" branch. Only weapon
rows are touched — a Type-0 row naming the same fid keeps its normal model pill (which is why Cata still reports one
unnamed file).

### 3d. The four-and-a-half sound routes

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  K5["kit EffectType 5"] --> SKID["SoundKitID"]
  MSND["SpellVisualMissile.SoundEntriesID"] --> SKID
  CSND["SpellChainEffects.SoundKitID"] --> SKID
  AESND["SpellVisual.AnimEventSoundID"] --> SKID
  SKID --> SKE["SoundKitEntry"] --> FID["sound FileDataIDs"]
```

The chain route is the "half": a beam's own sound folds into the spell's Sounds column and inherits the chain's target
mask.

`AnimEventSoundID` hangs off the `SpellVisual` row itself (not a kit or a missile), and its value is a `SoundKit::ID` —
the same type the missile route already eats — so it drops straight into the existing sound plumbing. It is the
**widest-reaching of these** — 1,999 spells on 9.2.7 (vs a few hundred each for the caster/hostile redirects), populated
on every pack including Vanilla — and it inherits the redirect target bit of whatever edge reached the visual.

### 3e. The animation routes

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  K6["kit ET 6 → SpellVisualAnim"] -->|AnimKitID| AKS["AnimKitSegment"] --> AID1["AnimIDs — grouped under an AnimKit head"]
  MAK["SpellVisualMissile.AnimKitID"] --> AKS
  K6 -->|" Initial/LoopAnimID "| AID2["AnimIDs — loose pills"]
  MA2["SpellVisualKitModelAttach"] -->|" AnimKitID "| AKS
  MA2 -->|" Start/Anim/EndAnimID "| AID2
  P7["proc Type 7"] --> AID3["AnimIDs — 'stance' group"]
  VS["VehicleSeat (via aura 296 → Vehicle)"] -->|" Enter/Ride/RideUpper/Exit anims "| AID4["AnimIDs — 'passenger' group"]
  VS -->|" VehicleEnter/Exit/RideAnimLoop "| AID2
  VS -->|" 6 × AnimKitID "| AKS
  AID1 --> N["names via anims.js"]
  AID2 --> N
  AID3 --> N
  AID4 --> N
```

`SpellVisualAnim`'s initial/loop anims are **the dominant source** — 119k rows vs 32k animkit rows on 9.2.7. `-1` and
`0` both mean unset (0 would be Stand). Impact kits animate the *target*, so these are not caster-only.

`SpellVisualKitModelAttach` carries animations on the SAME rows that attach a model (§3c, attachment point in §3h): its
`StartAnimID`/`AnimID`/`EndAnimID` are AnimationData ids for the attached model's start/loop/end and join the loose
pills; its `AnimKitID` rejoins the animkit groups. Keyed by kit, they union into the existing buckets (no pack section
of their own), and are indexed even when the row's `ModelFileDataID` is 0 (a Type 1/2 effect-name, whose model comes
from
`GenericID`, or a Type 3–10 equipped-weapon row that has no model at all), since they are anims the spell's kit plays.
Same `>0` gate as `SpellVisualAnim`. Adds
~10.5k animkit and ~6.7k loose-anim (spell,anim) pairs on 9.2.7.

The vehicle-seat route splits by **whose** animation it is: the nine passenger columns (`EnterAnimStart/Loop`,
`RideAnimStart/Loop`,
`RideUpperAnimStart/Loop`, `ExitAnimStart/Loop/End`) head a `passenger`
group, while the vehicle's own three (`VehicleEnterAnim`, `VehicleExitAnim`,
`VehicleRideAnimLoop`) join the loose pills — the rider's behaviour and the vehicle's are different things. The six
`*AnimKitID` columns are ordinary
`AnimKit::ID`s and rejoin the animkit groups, so the build counts them as
"used" and ships their segments. Population on 9.2.7: 99.8% of seats set at least one passenger anim, the vehicle's own
are 3–7%, any animkit 12.7%.

### 3f. Routes that start at `SpellEffect`, not at a visual

Eight fx categories skip the visual graph entirely: a particular `Effect` or
`EffectAura` enum makes `EffectMiscValue_n` an id into another table — or, for movement speed, makes
`EffectBasePoints` the payload itself.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  SE["SpellEffect"]
  SE -->|" EffectAura 56 (TRANSFORM)<br/>misc0 = creature id "| MO["morph"]
  SE -->|" Effect 28 (SUMMON)<br/>misc0 = creature, misc1 = SummonProperties "| SU["summon"]
  SE -->|" EffectAura 260 (SCREEN_EFFECT)<br/>misc0 = ScreenEffect id "| SC["screen"]
  SE -->|" EffectAura 36 (MOD_SHAPESHIFT)<br/>misc0 = SpellShapeshiftForm "| SS["shapeshift"]
  SE -->|" EffectAura 370 (OVERRIDE_NAME)<br/>misc0 = SpellOverrideName "| ON["alt names — search corpus only"]
  SE -->|" EffectAura 296 (SET_VEHICLE_ID)<br/>misc0 = Vehicle id "| VE["vehicle"]
  SE -->|" EffectAura 406 (KEYBOUND_OVERRIDE)<br/>misc0 = SpellKeyboundOverride "| KB["keybind"]
  SE -->|" EffectAura in SPEED_AURAS (14 of them)<br/>EffectBasePoints = the percent "| SP["speed"]
  SE -->|" Effect + EffectAura + ImplicitTarget "| ME["Mechanics column"]
```

**The vehicle route covers "the caster BECOMES a vehicle", not "boards one".**
`CONTROL_VEHICLE` (aura 236) is the far larger population — 1,581 rows vs 247 on 9.2.7 — but its `EffectMiscValue_0` is
a seat/flag value, not a
`Vehicle.db2` id, so it needs its own route and is deliberately not wired up.

**These effect-driven fx carry a target mask of their own** (pack format 25), and it does *not* come from the visual
graph — it is the producing
`SpellEffect` row's `ImplicitTarget_0`/`_1` (the `Target` enum, mapped to the same caster/target/area bits as §2's
`TargetType`, by `implicit_target_bit`). It answers *who the effect lands on*: a polymorph's morph is on the **target**,
a self-transform on the **caster**, a summon on the **area** where it lands. These rows never pass through
`SpellVisualEvent`, so `TargetType` says nothing about them — the implicit target is the only source. Alt-names (aura

370) are search-corpus-only and carry no mask.

**misc0 on a transform aura is a creature id, not a display id** — a long-standing trap. Both morphs and shapeshift
forms then walk the same creature→model chain:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  CR["creature entry"] -->|" TDB creature_template_model<br/>(or legacy modelid1..4) "| DI["CreatureDisplayID"]
  FORM["SpellShapeshiftForm.CreatureDisplayID"] --> DI
  DI --> CDI["CreatureDisplayInfo.ModelID"] --> CMD["CreatureModelData.FileDataID"] --> LF["listfile → model path"]
```

Screen effects are the one payload arriving from **both** directions — the aura route (~2.3k spells) and the kit route
via `SpellVisualScreenEffect` (18 rows on 9.2.7) — so the walk extends an already-populated set.

### 3g. Screen effect payload

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  SEF["ScreenEffect"] -->|" Param_0 (Effect=3) "| FOG["fog tint aarrggbb<br/>low 24 bits = color, top byte = opacity"]
  SEF -->|FullScreenEffectID| FSE["FullScreenEffect"]
  FSE --> GR["ColorMultiply / ColorAddition"]
  FSE --> VG["Mask triplet = radial vignette"]
  FSE -->|OverlayTextureFileDataID| OVL["overlay — finished art"]
  FSE -->|TextureBlendSetID| MSK["TextureBlendSet → mask textures"]
```

The two texture columns are **not interchangeable**: overlays are finished art drawn in their own colors, masks are flat
blend-set art the grade colors paint. The pack tags each texture with its role. The wiki's `rrggbbxx` claim for
`Param_0` is WotLK-era and wrong for modern rows — ours reads `aarrggbb`, settled by name semantics.

### 3h. Attachment points — where on the model something plays

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  MA["SpellVisualKitModelAttach.AttachmentID"] --> AN["M2 attachment name"]
  SV["SpellVisual.MissileAttachment<br/>+ MissileDestinationAttachment"] --> AN
  BE["BeamEffect.SourceAttachID<br/>+ DestAttachID"] --> AN
  AN --> P["pill segment — 'Chest' or 'SpellRightHand → Chest'"]
```

Three routes carry an attachment, and **all three are RAW M2 attachment ids**
(the `M2_ATTACHMENT_NAMES` table) — only `VehicleSeat` is indexed, see §3i. The id is part of the row key, so the same
model at two points stays two rows and renders as two pills: on 9.2.7, 44,906 (spell, fid, category) groups split this
way, and the split is what makes a caster/target difference visible instead of silently merged.

**Single-point vs travelling is a real distinction, not a formatting choice.**
Attached, ground, trail and barrage models sit at ONE point and render the bare name; missiles and beams travel and
render `Source → Dest`. The two are indistinguishable in the data (both look like "src set, dst unset"), so the renderer
is told explicitly — `TRAVELLING_MODEL_CATS` in app.js. A travelling row that knows only one end reads `from X` /
`to Y`; it must never render a dangling arrow.

Two traps:

- **`SpellVisualKitModelAttach.LowDefModelAttachID` is a FileDataID**, not an attachment — max 430259 on 9.2.7, despite
  the name.
- **Missile attachments are taken from `SpellVisual`, not
  `SpellVisualMissile`.** The missile route is per-visual (a whole set is unioned into one bucket) and that is also
  where the data lives: 105.6k rows carry a destination there versus 14.9k on the missile table. `spell_visual`
  in `TDB_TABLES` must overlay both columns — a hotfix row replaces the wago row wholesale, so omitting them would
  silently blank the attachments.

`SpellChainEffects` itself has **no** attachment column (its `Joint*` fields are geometry); beams attach through
`BeamEffect`, which is why chains only carry attach points on builds that have that table. Dissolve (`AttachID`, 307
rows), shadowy (`AttachPos`, 161) and barrage (`AttachmentPoint`, 7) also carry one and are deliberately not wired up
yet.

### 3i. Vehicle seat payload

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  V["Vehicle (via aura 296)"] -->|" SeatID_0..7 "| VS["VehicleSeat"]
  VS -->|" AttachmentID = INDEX "| GL["g_vehicleGeoComponentLinks[]"]
  GL -->|" M2 attachment id "| AN["attachment name — one pill per seat"]
  VS -->|" passenger anim columns "| PA["'passenger' anim group"]
  VS -->|" vehicle anim columns "| LP["loose anim pills"]
  VS -->|" AnimKit columns "| AK["animkit groups"]
```

A vehicle fills up to eight `SeatID_n` slots; the filled count IS the seat count, and 0-seat vehicles are dropped at
build.

**`VehicleSeat.AttachmentID` is an INDEX, not an M2 attachment id** — it indexes a table hardcoded in the client binary
(`g_vehicleGeoComponentLinks`), which exists in no db2 and so is transcribed into `build_data.py`. wowdev.wiki quotes
the array but hedges it with a `?`, so it was verified rather than trusted: 138 vehicle M2s were fetched and each seat
checked against its own vehicle's model. The decoded attachment is present **91.2%** of the time vs **42.4%** for the
raw value, and where the hypotheses diverge it is decisive — index 14 decodes to `VehicleSeat2`, present on 100% of the
models using it, while raw 14 (`ShoulderFlapLeft`) is present on 0%. Indices 13..20 come out as
`VehicleSeat1..8` in order, which the array's own shape corroborates.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- The array is 6.0.1-era; modern data has indices past its end (26, 27). Those stay unmapped and render as a raw `idx N`
  rather than a guess.
- The decoded names are the game's own and often read oddly as seat positions (`Breath` and `ChestBloodBack` are the 2nd
  and 4th most common on 9.2.7)
  because artists reuse generic attachment slots as seat anchors. **That is the data, not a decode error** — the pill
  tooltip says so explicitly.

**Do not reuse this decode for the other attachment columns** (§3h): they are *raw* M2 attachment ids.
`SpellVisualKitModelAttach.AttachmentID` spans -1..57 across 55 distinct values on 9.2.7 — the direct-id signature —
versus
`VehicleSeat.AttachmentID`'s dense 0..27.

### 3j. Keybound overrides — which key stops working

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  SE["SpellEffect<br/>EffectAura 406 (KEYBOUND_OVERRIDE)"]
  SE -->|" misc0 = SpellKeyboundOverride::ID "| KO["SpellKeyboundOverride"]
  KO -->|" Function "| FN["key name — the pill (JUMP, MOVEFORWARD, ...)"]
  KO -->|" Type "| TY["timing word — '' or 'mid-air'"]
  KO -->|" Data = Spell::ID "| SP["replacement spell — shipped, NOT displayed"]
```

While the aura holds, a movement/UI key stops doing what it normally does. The join is exact: **105/105 aura rows
resolve on 9.2.7**. On the newest builds the table trails the aura slightly — 11 rows on both DF and TWW point at an
override the build does not ship — and those are dropped rather than shown as a bare id.

**`Data` is a `Spell::ID`.** 46 of 53 distinct values on 9.2.7 are live spells; the other 7 (43574, 52477, 79579,
206768, 284741, 284991, 292038) are stale references to spells since deleted from the client DB2.

**The replacement spell is shipped but deliberately not displayed** (user's call, 2026-07-23). Retail casts it in the
key's place, but on **Epsilon the override only disables the key** — it never casts the replacement — so naming it would
promise behaviour Epsilon users cannot get. It stays in the pack (`keybinds.spells`) so a future pass can surface it
without a rebuild; restoring it means adding the id and name back to `keybindSearchL` in `data.js`
and to `keybindTag` in `app.js`, nothing more.

#### `Type` is decoded, not documented

Nothing documents this enum: the `.dbd` has no comment on `Type`, wowdev.wiki/DB/SpellKeyboundOverride is a 6.0.1
two-field stub, and EnumeratedString has no section for it. It was decoded from the data (2026-07-23) and the evidence
is strong enough to name:

- **100% of Type-1 rows are `JUMP`, on every build that has the table** — 0 of 13 rows on MoP, 2 Legion, 3 BfA, 7 SL, 23
  DF, 25 TWW. 60 rows, no exceptions. Type 0 spans all ten functions.
- Every Type-1 spell is a **mid-air** ability: Glide, `[DNT] Pirate Double
  Jump`, Jump Dash, Lift Off, Empowered Flight, Highland Drake, Gnomish Gravity Launcher, Defying Gravity, Faerie Wings,
  Zephyr's Catch, Wild Winds, Here's a Boost!, Prevent Jump. Every Type-0 spell replaces an ordinary ground press:
  Paddle Raft, Dodge Left/Right/Back, Locust Leap, Saurok Leap, Abandon Vehicle, Switch Seats, Flop, Stormforged Leap.
- **Decisive:** spell 319125 "Fizzle" appears as **both** Type 0 (override 173)
  and Type 1 (override 177) on the same function. Same payload, two rows — so
  `Type` is a trigger *condition*, not a kind of payload.

So **Type 0 = the ordinary press, Type 1 = the press while already airborne.**
Type 0 renders bare and only the mid-air case is labelled; an unknown future type falls back to `type N` rather than
being guessed at.

**`Flags` is deliberately not read**: absent from the table entirely on Legion and BfA, all-zero on 9.2.7, and only ten
nonzero rows (values 1 and 3) on TWW with no recoverable meaning. Reading it would buy a drift declaration and nothing
else.

### 3k. Movement speed — which movement, and by how much

The one `SpellEffect` route whose payload is not an id into another table: the **aura** says which movement is scaled and
`EffectBasePoints` says by what percent. Fourteen auras, five movement words.

| word      | auras                       | when it applies                      |
|-----------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `run`     | 31, 129, 171                | `MOVE_RUN` on foot                   |
| `mounted` | 32, 130, 172                | `MOVE_RUN` while mounted             |
| `swim`    | 58                          | `MOVE_SWIM`                          |
| `flight`  | 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211 | `MOVE_FLIGHT`                        |
| `all`     | 33                          | every movement type, applied last    |

**The mapping is `Unit::UpdateSpeed`** (TrinityCore `Entities/Unit/Unit.cpp`) — one function, one switch, and the whole
truth about which aura scales which movement. `MOVE_WALK` returns from it immediately, so walking takes no modifiers at
all and never appears here.

**The six flight auras deliberately share one word.** They all scale the same
`MOVE_FLIGHT` number and which of them applies is a question about the unit's *state* — mounted, in a vehicle, neither —
not about a different kind of movement. The branches overlap besides: 206 feeds the vehicle case *and* the unmounted
one, which is why druid Flight Form uses it. Splitting them would invent a distinction the engine does not make.

**The sign is the whole story, and the aura name is not.** 187 rows of
`MOD_DECREASE_SPEED` on 9.2.7 carry a *positive* amount and plenty of
`MOD_INCREASE_*` rows a negative one, so the pill prints the signed number and never translates it into a verb.
Zero-percent rows are kept (163 on 9.2.7 — Stealth's, whose real amount comes from a talent): "this spell has a speed
aura that changes nothing" is a fact about the row.

**A pill is the `(movement, percent)` pair**, and that pair is what the pack ships and the search matches on. Several
auras map to one movement, so a spell setting two of them to the same percent collapses to a single row rather than
rendering twins — The Quick and the Dead's four auras become three pills. `all` is never something the renderer
*derives*: no spell's separate auras add up to full coverage (the widest reaches four of the five, and never swim), so
it only ever comes from aura 33.

#### Verified against the game's own tooltips

A `Description_lang` writes an effect's value as `$s<N>%`, where N is the **1-based `EffectIndex`** — so the text names
which effect it is quoting. On 9.2.7, **4,590 such placeholders point at an effect carrying one of these auras and 4,574
(99.7%) resolve to a nonzero value**; the 16 zeros are the genuinely-zero rows above. That is a per-row check of both
the aura set and the column choice, and it is the cheapest oracle available for this route — rerun it whenever the set
changes.

#### `EffectBasePoints` has two spellings and every build has exactly one

The int column is the real one through Legion; the float `EffectBasePointsF` replaced it in BfA. Both are declared in
`OPTIONAL_COLUMNS` and read **int first**, because the overlap builds are a trap: **Vanilla, TBC and MoP export both and
leave the float at zero** (46 of 40,249 rows nonzero on Vanilla; zero on 771 of 783 speed rows). Preferring the float
would silently blank those three packs. `EffectBasePoints` also joins the TDB hotfix overlay for the usual
wholesale-replace reason — all four dumps that carry hotfixes at all spell it the int way, even TDB1127.

Values are rounded to one decimal, which drops the float32 conversion noise the modern builds carry
(`14.27999973297` → `14.3`) while keeping the ones that really are fractional (`47.5`). Eight rows on 9.2.7 are
fractional, sixteen on TWW.

#### What is deliberately not here

So a later pass does not "fix" an omission — the table in `build_data.py` is the extension point, one line each:

- **252 `MOD_SPEED_SLOW_ALL` — the name lies, and it is the one trap in this family.** TrinityCore handles it with
  `HandleModCombatSpeedPct`, i.e. `ApplyCastTimePercentMod` + `ApplyAttackTimePercentMod`, exactly like 193
  `MELEE_SLOW`; it never touches movement. The data agrees — Icy Touch's −15% is Frost Fever's attack-speed slow.
- **191 `USE_NORMAL_MOVEMENT_SPEED`, 437 `MOD_MINIMUM_SPEED_RATE`** — real movement auras, but the amount is an absolute
  speed in yards/sec (`UpdateSpeed`
  divides it by `baseMoveSpeed`), not a percent. 205 + 65 spells on 9.2.7.
- **305 `MOD_MINIMUM_SPEED`, 373 `MOD_SPEED_NO_CONTROL`, 388 `MOD_TAXI_FLIGHT_SPEED`** — percents, but of a floor, an
  uncontrolled dash and a taxi flight rather than a change to a speed. They need a word of their own before they can
  render. 113 + 36 + 1 spells.
- **513–524, the skyriding physics auras** (air friction, lift coefficient, banking rate) — a different mechanic in
  different units, TWW only.

### 3l. The Mechanics column — effects paired with their targets

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  SE["SpellEffect row"]
  SE -->|" Effect enum "| EF["SPELL_EFFECT_* name"]
  SE -->|" EffectAura enum "| AU["SPELL_AURA_* name"]
  SE -->|" ImplicitTarget_0 / _1 "| IT["TARGET_* names"]
  IT -->|" implicit_target_bit() "| MK["caster / target / area icons"]
  EF --> P["one pill"]
  AU --> P
  MK --> P
```

Until pack format 29 this column shipped **two flat per-spell sets** — "this spell has `APPLY_AURA` and
`TRIGGER_MISSILE` somewhere" and "it has
`PERIODIC_DAMAGE` somewhere" — with the effect index and the effect↔aura pairing discarded at build. Format 29 ships
**one row per distinct
`SpellEffect`** instead, so what an effect does and what it is aimed at stay attached to each other.

Why it matters: Lava Burst (51505) is `TRIGGER_MISSILE → UNIT_TARGET_ENEMY`
plus `ENERGIZE → UNIT_CASTER`. Flat, that is four unordered pills and nothing says the missile is the enemy-aimed half.
**28,705 of 276,168 spells (10.4%)
have both more than one kind of effect and more than one distinct target** — exactly the population a flat set cannot
describe.

Rows are deduped on `(spell, effect, aura, targetA, targetB)`, which collapses the per-`DifficultyID` copies
`SpellEffect` ships: 416,865 rows become 372,111 on 9.2.7. That dedupe is why the pairing is **nearly free**: the
section costs 1.21 MB gzipped against the 1.17 MB the two flat sets it replaces cost, so the whole 9.2.7 pack grew **+34
KB (+0.4%)** — 7,873,061 → 7,907,511 bytes. TWW grew +0.3%; Vanilla, whose spells rarely carry two targets, got 1.7%
*smaller*.

**What renders, and what only searches.** The pill shows the specific thing first and the carrier second —
`PERIODIC_DAMAGE | APPLY_AURA`, not the reverse — so the aura name leads and the near-universal `APPLY_AURA` reads as
the boilerplate it is. **Who it lands on is shown only as the existing caster/target/area icons** (user's call,
2026-07-23): the `TARGET_*` names are long, would dominate the pill and repeat down the column. They stay in the tooltip
and stay searchable, because the icons cannot tell
`UNIT_TARGET_ENEMY` from `UNIT_TARGET_ALLY`.

Two consequences of hiding the names:

- Pills that would render identically are merged, keeping every underlying row for the tooltip and the hit test.
  Soulstone (20707) has two `DUMMY` effects, one aimed at `CORPSE_TARGET_ALLY` and one at `UNIT_TARGET_ALLY` — both "on
  the target", so they are one pill whose tooltip names both.
- The **CSV/JSON export spells the targets out** (`PERIODIC_DAMAGE /
  APPLY_AURA -> TARGET_UNIT_CASTER`), one line per raw row: an export is read without tooltips or icons.

**`mech:` matches whole rows, not names.** `mech:"school_damage
unit_target_enemy"` means *one effect that is both* (7,826 spells on 9.2.7) — the whole reason for pairing. Matching
that literally would mean building a corpus string per row, so it is done on ids: each token resolves to the id sets
whose name contains it (~980 names to scan), then the flat row arrays are swept testing membership. That is ~10x faster
than walking the per-spell row objects (170 ms → 15–25 ms per query on 372k rows). A row's `0` means "no effect" / "no
aura" / "target unset" and never matches — without that guard `mech:none` would return every aura-less row, since
`SPELL_AURA_NONE` really is named `NONE`.

**The icon mask is not stored per row.** `implicitTargetBits` ships the
~130-entry map instead, and a row's mask is `bits[targetA] | bits[targetB]`. A fourth 372k-long parallel array measured
110 KB gzipped for data derivable from a 1 KB map.

---

## 4. The pack

The build bakes everything into one gzipped, **column-oriented** JSON per game version: a section like
`{spellIds, fids}` is parallel arrays where row *i*
links `spellIds[i]` to `fids[i]`. That gzips far better than a list of objects.

Sections carrying a parallel `targets` array (the target-icon feature):
`spellModels`, `spellSounds`, `spellAnimKits`, `spellVisualAnims`, `spellFx`,
`spellDissolves`, `spellGlows`, `spellShadowies`, `spellGhostMats` (these from
`SpellVisualEvent.TargetType`, §2), plus — from `SpellEffect.ImplicitTarget`
(§3f, pack format 25) — `spellMorphs`, `spellSummons`, `spellVehicles`,
`spellShapeshifts`, `spellScreens`, `spellSpeeds`. Both feed the same `maskIndex` in `data.js`
and the same icon renderer, so the two mask sources are indistinguishable downstream.

`data.js` builds a **forward and a reverse index** for each — spell→items for rendering, item→spells for searching.
Every section read is guarded (`if (pack.X)`) so an older-format pack degrades rather than crashes.

## 5. Version differences

Ten builds ship, spanning 2004-era content to current retail. Going *backwards*
is a different problem from going forwards: forwards is additive, backwards is mostly "the table does not exist yet."
The five Classic re-release clients (Vanilla / TBC / WotLK / Cataclysm / MoP) complicate that — see below.

### The ten packs

| Build        | Label                     |  Spells |    Pack | TDB release   | Absent tables |
|--------------|---------------------------|--------:|--------:|---------------|--------------:|

| 2.5.6.68775  | TBC Classic               |  28,650 |  0.7 MB | —             |            14 |
| 3.4.3.58936  | WotLK Classic             |  49,394 |  1.3 MB | TDB335.25101  |            11 |
| 4.4.2.60895  | Cataclysm Classic         |  71,227 |  1.9 MB | —             |            11 |
| 5.5.4.68716  | Mists of Pandaria Classic |  98,129 |  2.6 MB | —             |             6 |
| 7.3.5.26972  | Legion                    | 179,382 |  5.0 MB | TDB735.00     |             4 |
| 8.3.7.35662  | Battle for Azeroth        | 227,237 |  6.5 MB | TDB837.20101  |             1 |
| 9.2.7.45745  | Shadowlands *(default)*   | 276,332 |  7.9 MB | TDB927.22111  |             0 |
| 10.2.7.55664 | Dragonflight              | 327,092 |  9.5 MB | TDB1027.24051 |             0 |
| 11.2.7.65299 | The War Within            | 375,895 | 11.1 MB | TDB1127.26011 |             0 |

**All ten are at pack format 30** (movement-speed modifiers, §3k — on top of format 29's mechanics paired with their
implicit targets, §3l, and the keybound-override route, §3j). The four pre-MoP packs each gained one absent table,
`SpellKeyboundOverride`; nothing else drifted. Recent
bumps are additive and version-agnostic: format 26 added the invis/detect channel pills (`MOD_INVISIBILITY[_DETECT]`
auras), format 27 the `display` model category, format 28 the `item` category, format 29 replaced the flat
`spellEffects`/`spellAuras` sets with `spellMechanics` and added
`implicitTargetNames`/`implicitTargetBits` + `spellKeybinds`/`keybinds`. A format-28 pack is still read: its two flat
sets load as target-less mechanic rows, so the column renders without target segments or icons rather than breaking.
Format 26–28 all carry back to Vanilla (SpellVisualEffectName.Type is present on every shipped build — no absent-table
or optional-column drift; the five item tables also ship on every build, so the route degrades by *content*, not by a
missing table). Earlier format costs still hold: format 22 target masks ~+11% size, format 23 vehicles essentially free,
format 24 attachment points ~+18% model rows, format 25 one
`targets` array per effect-fx link section. Format 28 renamed `spellModels`'s
`displayIds` array to `refIds` (it now carries an Item::ID on item rows too) and added the `items`/`itemIconNames`/
`itemQualityNames` sections; a format-27 pack is still read (its `displayIds` array is accepted as `refIds`). Splitting
the equipped-weapon marker per slot (§3c) needed **no** bump — it only changes which sentinel fids appear in the
existing `files`/`spellModels` sections, and the frontend reads any negative fid as fileless rather than naming one.
**Format 29 is close to free**: pairing replaced two flat sections with one (9.2.7 +0.4%, TWW +0.3%, Vanilla −1.7%), and
the keybind sections are ~1 KB. **Format 30 is nearly free too** — one link section of 5.7k rows on 9.2.7, under 0.1 MB
gzipped, and no pack changed size band.

### Movement speed by version

Rows are `(spell, movement, percent)` pills; a spell can hold several. Both columns of the route — the fourteen auras
and `EffectBasePoints` — exist on **every** shipped build, so there is no drift declaration: the route degrades by
*content*, and the only era difference it shows is the real one.

| Pack         |  rows | spells |   run | mounted | swim | flight |   all |
|--------------|------:|-------:|------:|--------:|-----:|-------:|------:|
| 1.15.8.67156 |   782 |    768 |   210 |     182 |   20 |  **0** |   367 |
| 2.5.6.68775  | 1,056 |    964 |   194 |     251 |   25 |     71 |   502 |
| 3.4.3.58936  | 1,369 |  1,303 |   323 |      70 |   35 |     81 |   839 |
| 4.4.2.60895  | 1,661 |  1,587 |   453 |      49 |   58 |    103 |   981 |
| 5.5.4.68716  | 2,231 |  2,131 |   681 |      63 |   77 |    110 | 1,266 |
| 7.3.5.26972  | 3,782 |  3,581 | 1,172 |     104 |  111 |    148 | 2,171 |
| 8.3.7.35662  | 4,722 |  4,441 | 1,393 |     142 |  157 |    170 | 2,750 |
| 9.2.7.45745  | 5,696 |  5,361 | 1,695 |     164 |  171 |    196 | 3,336 |
| 10.2.7.55664 | 6,803 |  6,415 | 2,061 |     205 |  180 |    242 | 3,962 |
| 11.2.7.65299 | 7,849 |  7,388 | 2,363 |     232 |  187 |    271 | 4,599 |

**Vanilla has zero flight rows** — flying arrived in TBC, so the six flight auras have nothing to attach to on 1.15.8.
That is the data telling the truth, not a missing table: the `flight` word simply never renders there.

`all` is the largest group everywhere, which is expected — it is aura 33, i.e. every snare in the game.

### Keybound overrides by version

Rows are `(spell, override)` links; overrides are the distinct
`SpellKeyboundOverride` rows they reach. The table arrives in **MoP (5.0.1)** — the four earlier packs 404 it and the
`keybind` category simply never appears.

| Build                 | Table rows | Aura 406 rows | Shipped links | Overrides | Dropped |
|-----------------------|-----------:|--------------:|--------------:|----------:|--------:|
| Vanilla 1.15.8        |   *absent* |             — |             0 |         0 |       — |
| TBC 2.5.6             |   *absent* |             — |             0 |         0 |       — |
| WotLK 3.4.3           |   *absent* |             — |             0 |         0 |       — |
| Cataclysm 4.4.2       |   *absent* |             — |             0 |         0 |       — |
| MoP 5.5.4             |         13 |            14 |            13 |        10 |       1 |
| Legion 7.3.5          |         49 |            53 |            53 |        41 |       0 |
| BfA 8.3.7             |         56 |            72 |            72 |        47 |       0 |
| Shadowlands 9.2.7     |         77 |           105 |           105 |        64 |       0 |
| Dragonflight 10.2.7   |        126 |           174 |           163 |       106 |      11 |
| The War Within 11.2.7 |        147 |           208 |           197 |       121 |      11 |

"Dropped" is aura rows whose `misc0` names an override the build does not ship — the table trailing the aura on the
newest two builds, and one stale row on MoP. Distinct implicit-target names shipped per build (`implicitTargets`) grows
the same way: 85 on Vanilla, 98 WotLK, 123 MoP, 133 from Shadowlands on.

### Attachment coverage by version

Read from each pack after the format-24 rebuild:

| Pack                    | model rows | with an attach point | missiles w/ both ends | beams w/ both ends |
|-------------------------|-----------:|---------------------:|----------------------:|-------------------:|
| Vanilla 1.15.8 (fmt 22) |     31,651 |                    — |                     — |                  — |
| TBC 2.5.6 (fmt 22)      |     35,006 |                    — |                     — |                  — |
| WotLK 3.4.3             |     74,693 |               68,565 |                   718 |                  0 |
| Cataclysm 4.4.2         |     94,285 |               84,859 |                 1,412 |                  0 |
| MoP 5.5.4               |    126,079 |              110,706 |                 2,289 |                  1 |
| Legion 7.3.5            |    214,432 |              200,466 |                 3,563 |                537 |
| BfA 8.3.7               |    264,466 |              198,655 |                 3,592 |              2,448 |
| Shadowlands 9.2.7       |    314,064 |              226,810 |                 3,753 |              5,273 |
| Dragonflight 10.2.7     |    368,230 |              252,382 |                 3,977 |              7,237 |
| TWW 11.2.7              |    418,432 |              278,576 |                 4,085 |              9,013 |

Beam attach points need `BeamEffect`, which WotLK and Cataclysm lack — hence the zeroes, and MoP's single row.
Attached-model coverage is high everywhere (~85-92% of rows outside BfA).

### Creature-display models by version

`display`-category rows (`SpellVisualEffectName` Type 2, §3c), read from each pack's `meta.counts.spellDisplayModels`.
`SpellVisualEffectName.Type` is present on every shipped build, so the route degrades by *content*, not by a missing
column — the Classic re-releases simply carry few Type-2 attach rows.

| Pack            | display rows | | Pack                | display rows |
|-----------------|-------------:|-|---------------------|-------------:|
| Vanilla 1.15.8  |           23 | | BfA 8.3.7           |          721 |
| TBC 2.5.6       |            1 | | Shadowlands 9.2.7   |        1,087 |
| WotLK 3.4.3     |            0 | | Dragonflight 10.2.7 |        1,432 |
| Cataclysm 4.4.2 |            4 | | TWW 11.2.7          |        1,827 |
| MoP 5.5.4       |           48 | |                     |              |
| Legion 7.3.5    |          445 | |                     |              |

WotLK 3.4.3's zero is data-truthful (that Classic client has no Type-2 attach row resolving to a display), not a build
failure. All rows resolve to a real model fid — unresolvable displays are dropped at build time.

### Item models by version

`item`-category rows (`SpellVisualEffectName` Type 1, §3c), from each pack's
`meta.counts` — `spellItemModels` (rows), `items` (distinct), `namedItems`
(with an `ItemSearchName` name). Attach route only.

| Pack            | item rows | items | named | | Pack                | item rows | items | named |
|-----------------|----------:|------:|------:|-|---------------------|----------:|------:|------:|
| Vanilla 1.15.8  |        36 |    18 |    10 | | BfA 8.3.7           |       935 |   562 |   562 |
| TBC 2.5.6       |         0 |     0 |     0 | | Shadowlands 9.2.7   |     1,211 |   651 |   433 |
| WotLK 3.4.3     |         0 |     0 |     0 | | Dragonflight 10.2.7 |     1,431 |   709 |   467 |
| Cataclysm 4.4.2 |         0 |     0 |     0 | | TWW 11.2.7          |     1,579 |   764 |   497 |
| MoP 5.5.4       |         0 |     0 |     0 | |                     |           |       |       |
| Legion 7.3.5    |       719 |   481 |   481 | |                     |           |       |       |

TBC through MoP are data-truthful zeroes: those Classic clients carry no Type-1 attach row (the route first appears in
the retail-line Legion data and, oddly, in a handful of Vanilla Classic rows). Legion/BfA showing 100% named is also the
data — the nameless internal-prop items (potions, dynamite) are reached mainly on the later builds. The named share is
what decides the pill shape per row.

### Equipped-weapon markers by version

Sentinel rows (`SpellVisualEffectName` Type 3–10, §3c), read from each pack's
`meta.counts.spellWeaponModels` and split by slot from its `spellModels` fids. Like the display route, `Type` ships on
every build, so this degrades by content only.

| Pack                | rows | main hand | off hand | ranged | ammo |
|---------------------|-----:|----------:|---------:|-------:|-----:|
| Vanilla 1.15.8      |    0 |         0 |        0 |      0 |    0 |
| TBC 2.5.6           |   46 |        22 |        5 |      5 |   14 |
| WotLK 3.4.3         |  140 |        85 |       10 |      8 |   37 |
| Cataclysm 4.4.2     |  248 |       115 |       18 |     37 |   78 |
| MoP 5.5.4           |  357 |       195 |       26 |     48 |   88 |
| Legion 7.3.5        |  626 |       401 |       46 |     80 |   99 |
| BfA 8.3.7           |  678 |       427 |       47 |     90 |  114 |
| Shadowlands 9.2.7   |  698 |       477 |       49 |     93 |   79 |
| Dragonflight 10.2.7 |  732 |       510 |       48 |     97 |   77 |
| TWW 11.2.7          |  754 |       526 |       46 |    103 |   79 |

Vanilla's 0 is data-truthful: its single Type-3 effect-name (8905) is not reached by any kit or missile set, so no spell
shows the marker. Its pack predates the count and omits the key — it was deliberately **not** rebuilt for a zero-valued
diagnostic field (see "the build is deterministic" in CLAUDE.md). WotLK and Cata are the two packs whose numbers depend
on the placeholder-fid rule in §3c: before it they read 132 and **0**. The per-slot split added 2–3 rows per pack over
the single-sentinel build: where one spell threw *both* weapons at the same attachment point the merged row is now two
pills (9.2.7's three are the Demon Hunter glaive spells — Fury of the Illidari ×2, Glaive Tempest).

### The five Classic re-release clients don't sit on the timeline

Vanilla Classic (1.15.8), TBC Classic (2.5.6), WotLK Classic (3.4.3), Cataclysm Classic (4.4.2) and MoP Classic (5.5.4)
are *not* points on the retail line — they are current-generation Classic clients backporting old content, so a client's
db2 set reflects its fork point, not the game era. The absent-table counts therefore do **not** nest by era:

- **TBC Classic is the most stripped client of the ten** (13 absent = WotLK's 10 + `TextureBlendSet` + `Vehicle` +
  `VehicleSeat`).
- **Cataclysm Classic is as stripped as WotLK Classic** (10 absent) — the 4.4.x client still lacks `BeamEffect`,
  `DissolveEffect`, `EdgeGlowEffect`,
  `SpellEffectEmission`, `WeaponTrail` and `FullScreenEffect`.
- **Vanilla Classic and MoP Classic are the richest of the five** (6 absent each) — but *differently*: Vanilla keeps
  `BeamEffect`, `DissolveEffect`,
  `EdgeGlowEffect` and `FullScreenEffect`; MoP keeps those three effect tables plus `SpellEffectEmission` (ground
  models), and is the only Classic client with the emission route populated, but drops `FullScreenEffect`.
- **Only WotLK Classic has a TDB** (the 3.3.5 world-only dump). Vanilla, TBC, Cataclysm and MoP all build TDB-less:
  creature morph and summon *names/displays* don't resolve (the pills fall back to raw ids), and no hotfix overlay
  applies. Summon *control* words (guardian/pet/…) still work — those come from `SummonProperties`, a client table.

Everything else — models, sounds, animations, mechanics, tints, transparency, freeze, shapeshifts — works on all four.
Unlike the original-3.3.5 data, these modern Classic clients carry the full proc enum (each has a Type-21 desaturate
row), so the "proc types stop at 17" cutoff below is a WotLK *Classic* client trait, not a general Classic one.

### When each table arrived

This is the *retail* client progression; the Classic re-release clients above fork off it and are covered in the
previous section.

```mermaid

  W["WotLK 3.4.3<br/>11 absent"] --> L["Legion 7.3.5<br/>4 absent"] --> B["BfA 8.3.7<br/>1 absent"] --> S["Shadowlands 9.2.7+<br/>complete"]
  W -.->|" gained at Legion "| G1["BeamEffect · DissolveEffect<br/>EdgeGlowEffect · ShadowyEffect<br/>FullScreenEffect · SpellEffectEmission<br/>WeaponTrail · SpellKeyboundOverride<br/>(the last arrives at MoP)"]

  B -.->|" gained at Shadowlands "| G3["SpellVisualScreenEffect<br/>(the kit route into screen fx)"]
```

**`SpellName` is the one non-monotonic case** and worth understanding: it was split out of `Spell.db2` in BfA, so Legion
carries the name on `Spell.Name_lang`
— but WotLK *Classic* is a modern client and has `SpellName` normally. The absence tracks the client generation, not the
game era. `SPELL_NAME_SOURCES`
picks whichever exists.

### What that costs each version

Everything else — models, sounds, animations, mechanics (including their implicit targets), morphs, summons,
shapeshifts, tints, transparency, freeze — works on all ten. `SpellEffect.ImplicitTarget_0/_1` in particular is present
on every shipped build, so the §3l pairing needs no drift declaration; only the number of distinct target names varies
(85 on Vanilla → 133 from Shadowlands).

### Vehicles by version

Counts read from each pack's `meta.counts` after the format-23 rebuild:

| Pack                | format | spell→vehicle | seats | passenger anims | seat animkits |
|---------------------|:------:|--------------:|------:|----------------:|--------------:|
| Vanilla 1.15.8      |   22   |             — |     — |               — |             — |
| TBC 2.5.6           |   22   |             — |     — |               — |             — |
| WotLK 3.4.3         |   23   |             4 |     6 |              24 |             0 |
| Cataclysm 4.4.2     |   23   |            59 |    92 |             259 |             2 |
| MoP 5.5.4           |   23   |           121 |   221 |             596 |            10 |
| Legion 7.3.5        |   23   |           162 |   292 |             795 |            21 |
| BfA 8.3.7           |   23   |           185 |   328 |             909 |            22 |
| Shadowlands 9.2.7   |   23   |           233 |   384 |           1,138 |            44 |
| Dragonflight 10.2.7 |   23   |           293 |   419 |           1,397 |            49 |
| TWW 11.2.7          |   23   |           323 |   464 |           1,529 |            57 |

**Vanilla and TBC were deliberately not rebuilt** — vehicles are a WotLK-era feature, so those two stay at format 22 and
simply carry no vehicle sections. The runtime guards every section read, so mixed pack formats are fine.

**WotLK's 4 is real, not a bug.** Aura 296 *is* `SET_VEHICLE_ID` on that build (verified via `read_enum_names`, so it is
not enum drift) — WotLK Classic just has 7 `SET_VEHICLE_ID` rows in the whole of `SpellEffect`. The expansion that
introduced vehicles overwhelmingly uses `CONTROL_VEHICLE` (aura 236, 213 rows there) instead, which is a different route
we do not surface.

### Two things that look like bugs and are not

**Empty sections are often the enum, not the table.** WotLK's ghost-material, desaturate and camo sections are empty
even though no *table* is missing: those come from `SpellProceduralEffect` types 22, 21 and 18, and **WotLK's proc types
stop at 17**. The enum is append-only, so the cutoff is exactly what the counts show — freeze (Type 11) and transparency
(Type 14) are populated on WotLK, and everything above 17 is zero.

**Category searches can return rows for a feature this build lacks.** That is the documented filename-substring
behavior, not a fallback. On WotLK
`fx:desaturate` still matches `healbeam_desaturated`, `model:trail` matches
`ribbontrail`, and `fx:glow` matches `beam_webglowwhite`.

### Era differences visible in the data

Some gaps are content, not schema — the same route exists, the game just used it differently:

| Section            |  WotLK |   9.2.7 | Reading                                                                                       |
|--------------------|-------:|--------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `spellAnimKits`    |    446 |  42,415 | AnimKits barely existed in the WotLK era (its 446 come mostly from the §3e ModelAttach route) |
| `spellVisualAnims` | 39,247 | 125,793 | …but `SpellVisualAnim` was already the dominant animation source                              |
| `spellSounds`      | 71,474 | 674,779 | modern spells carry far denser sound graphs                                                   |
| `spellShapeshifts` |     69 |     120 | forms grew slowly; displays actually *shrank* (20 → 18)                                       |

### Drift is declared, not branched

Five declarations near the top of `build_data.py` absorb all of the above, so the readers stay version-agnostic — adding
a version is a config edit, not a code edit:

| Declaration                                                                 | Handles                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OPTIONAL_TABLES`                                                           | Table postdates the build → 404 tolerated, section empty, feature switches off.                                                                                                      |
| `OPTIONAL_COLUMNS`                                                          | Table exists, one column doesn't → default stands in (3 so far: two missile-set variants, plus `ReducedUnexpectedCameraMovementSpellVisualID` absent on Legion 7.3.5 and BfA 8.3.7). |
| `SPELL_NAME_SOURCES`                                                        | Data moved tables — first candidate that exists wins.                                                                                                                                |
| `TDB_OPTIONAL_TABLES` / `TDB_OPTIONAL_COLUMNS` / `CREATURE_DISPLAY_SOURCES` | The same three kinds of drift on the TrinityCore side, in its own namespace.                                                                                                         |
| `array_columns()`                                                           | A column that changed shape — `CreatureDisplayID_0..3` became a scalar in 10.2.0.                                                                                                    |

**Anything not declared is still a hard error.** An unexpected schema change must fail the build loudly rather than
silently lose data. To add a version, run the build and let it tell you what is missing, then decide per item whether it
belongs in a declaration or is a genuine bug.

### TDB-side caveats

- **WotLK's world data is not an exact build match.** TDB335 targets original 3.3.5a, not the 3.4.x Classic client. It
  is the only creature name/display source for the era and resolution looks fine, but treat WotLK morph and summon names
  as best-effort.
- **Legion-era and 3.3.5 dumps have no `creature_template_model`** — displays live in `modelid1..4` columns on
  `creature_template` instead.
- **TDB335 is world-only** (no hotfixes dump), and TDB735 nests its SQLs in a subfolder without the `full_` infix. Both
  shapes are declared in
  `TDB_RELEASES`.
- **Vanilla Classic (1.15.8) and TBC Classic (2.5.6) have no TDB at all** — TrinityCore ships no 1.15/2.5 world
  database, so they are absent from
  `TDB_RELEASES` and `fetch_tdb` returns `None`. Morph/summon names and displays don't resolve for those two builds (raw
  ids only); every wago-sourced section is unaffected.

## 6. Runtime routes (browser, on demand)

Nothing here is fetched during search or bulk-downloaded. All of it is user-triggered and configured in
`docs/js/config.js`.

| Wowhead         | `wowhead.com/{wh}spell=` · `/{wh}npc=` · `/{wh}sound=` · `#modelviewer:` | Link-out only. `{wh}` = per-version site prefix (`config.js` `wowheadSitePrefix`): Vanilla → `classic/`, everything else → retail (empty). Only `/classic/` and retail are permanent Wowhead sections, so the mid-Classic clients point at retail rather than a seasonal section that will rot. The model viewer (morph/display pills) has no `{wh}` — always retail (best skin compositing; display IDs render cross-era). |

House rule, unchanged: **fetch only on explicit user action, never preload, never bulk-download.** The icon and sound
hotlinks sit on tolerated-hotlinking footing, not an affirmative license.

| **Target bits**  | `SpellVisualEvent.TargetType` on the kit edge (§2), resolved against `SpellEffect.ImplicitTarget` per phase (`StartEvent`) so a self-cast spell's "Target" reads as the caster, plus `Caster`/`HostileSpellVisualID` redirects that mark whatever they reach caster/target                                                      |
